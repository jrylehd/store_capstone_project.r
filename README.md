# Application of Data Analysis in Business with R Programming Capstone Project

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are provided with a dataset of a departmental store.
It contains details of products from May, 2020, a period marked by COVID-19.
Your manager wants you to find out that investing in which products will be more profitable.
Your objective is to analyse the patterns and trends of the products, and gather insights for strategic decision making.

Some of the skills I learned and retained for this project were to...

... create and modify new datasets using dplyr package (filter(), arrange(), slice(), select(), mutate()).

... query wanted information using the summarize() and group_by() functions.

... create data visualizations using the ggplot2 package (i.e. column plot, line plot, scatter plot, historgrams, pie charts, donut charts, coxcomb charts).

... find correlations between two variables using corrplot package and visualize that data using the ggcorrplot package.
