# Application of Data Analysis in Business with R Programming Capstone Project
Used a dataset of a departmental store containing the details of products from May, 2020, a period marked by COVID-19.


Scenario: My manager wants me to find out which products will be more profitable when invested into.
Analyze the patterns and trends of the products, and gather insights for strategic decision making.


Some of the skills I learned and retained for this project were to...

... create and modify new datasets using dplyr package (filter(), arrange(), slice(), select(), mutate()).

... query wanted information using the summarize() and group_by() functions.

... create data visualizations using the ggplot2 package (i.e. column plot, line plot, scatter plot, historgrams, pie charts, donut charts, coxcomb charts).

... find correlations between two variables using corrplot package and visualize that data using the ggcorrplot package.
